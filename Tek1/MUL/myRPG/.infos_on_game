The game take place in a fantasist middle-age. Your name is Godefroy de Montmirail, your mission is to explore the popular places of the map and kill all the enemies.
Such as goblins that try to steal everyone's money or their bandit boss that you have to find and kill before there is no money left in your small city Ilragorn.

Move on the map with 'Z' to go up, 'Q' to go left, 'S' to go down and 'D' to go right.

You can fight an enemy when you are close enough to him and you press 'F' key. 
Once in the fight, use A to attack, E to heal yourself and R to runaway.

Open your inventory with 'I' key and close it the same way.

Press 'echap' key to activate the pause menu.
