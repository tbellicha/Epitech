# Packets

Packets are identified by a common header made of:

- A [ULEB128](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEB128) encoded 32-bit type identifier, each packet type gets it's own id.binary buffer to string in c
- The size of the payload (not including this header), encoded as a [ULEB128](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEB128) 32-bit unsigned integer.

## Data Types

- `TYPE[LENGTH]` : sequence of exact size LENGTH of TYPE (e.g. Byte[16] is a sequence of 16 bytes)
- `TYPE[MIN : MAX]` : arbitrary sequence of length between MIN (inclusive) and MAX (inclusive) of elements of type TYPE.
- `{ name1: TYPE_1, name2: TYPE_2, ... }` : tuple. (e.g. `{ id: UUID, length: U32, name: Byte[length]}`)
- `U32` : a [ULEB128](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEB128) encoded 32-bit unsigned integer.
- `U64` : a [ULEB128](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEB128) encoded 64-bit unsigned integer.
- `Byte` : a byte.
- `UUID`  : a RFC-4122 compliant Universally Unique Identifier, encoded as 16 bytes. Same representation as `Byte[16]`
- `Timestamp`: seconds since the UNIX epoch, encoded as `U64`
- `Context`: encoded as `U32`, the valid values are:
    - 0: no context
    - 1: the user is inside a team
    - 2: the user is inside a channel
    - 3: the user is inside a thread
